# Mission / Vision Proposal

Here I (Sam) will propose a new version of the mission / vision for the academy. I aim for the mission to carry us and 
stay relevant for about 5 years and the vision to stay relevant for about 10 years.

## Strategy 

The strategy should focus on knowledge transfer. Producing world-class material that helps people improve 
their lives is a good way to build an effective community.

In terms of implementation, it is proposed to:

Create a new organization called the Portugal Data Science Academy (PDSA) that adopts the Vision laid out in this document.
Keep the Lisbon Data Science Academy (and by extension the Starters Academy and prep course) with the same mission but 
adopt the Vision of the PDSA.

The two organizations will be coupled under the current legal umbrella of the LDSA. The LDSA will continue to operate 
as-is while the PDSA will be responsible for taking any material produced by the LDSA and packaging it for distribution. 
This packaged material (it can be ANYTHING) will be distributed under a permissive open source license so anybody in 
the world can adopt and make any modifications that they like. Once the material is distribution-ready, the PDSA will 
provide limited guidance to those starting up their own satellite organization. I say “limited” because the goal should 
be for any satellite organization to be 100% self-sustainable and so providing too much guidance or help may undermine 
that (not to mention the issue of time). Then, when satellite organizations start to produce material that furthers 
the vision, the PDSA will start distributing said material in the same way that it does for the LDSA.

The packaging, promotion, and distribution of satellite organization material is how the PDSA will achieve its mission.

## Portugal Data Science Academy

### Vision
To live in a world in which anyone can belong to a community where they learn responsible, ethical, and professional 
Data Science with minimal compromise on lifestyle.

### Mission
To facilitate the creation of independent Data Science academies by making it easy to leverage the material, 
knowledge, and infrastructure created by the Lisbon Data Science Academy.

### Interpretation and Notes

In sacrificing some degree of efficiency in favor of robustness, I propose a radically decentralized collection 
of organizations that have full autonomy in how they operate but share a common Vision. No one of these organizations 
should have authority over any of the others which leaves kindness, diplomacy, compromise, and respect as the main 
vehicles by which a realization of the Vision is coordinated.

Take, for example, the U.S. presidential electoral system. It is radically decentralized as there are thousands of 
independent polling places that are operated independently using a range of pencil and paper to state of the art 
computerized systems in order to collect votes from their respective districts. This opens up some problems in 
which individual polling places can be compromised (read Bush V. Gore) while at the same time making it nearly 
impossible to compromise the entire system. Is messy, takes a long time to count votes, and every once in a while 
the system fails. However, because the individual polling places are siloed, there are two main benefits: 

1. The damage can usually be contained.
2. The system is robust to outright corruption by a single entity.

The vision is meant to be a big but achievable goal. It is not as big as it could be (e.g. to teach the world Data Science) 
in order to facilitate focus. It is big enough to give us something meaningful to work on for many years to come.

## LDSA Mission / Vision

### Vision
Adopted from the parent organization.

### Mission

To create a maintain a community of excellence in Lisbon with the teaching and learning of Data Science at its core.


### Interpretation and Notes

The inclusion of the words responsible, ethical, and professional in the vision necessitates that any execution of 
the teaching of DS have full respect for nuance in the context of the society in which it is being taught. This 
requirement of nuance and context implies decentralization so that instances of schools can focus on their community 
which they know best. It is for this reason also that the Mission is scoped to Portugal. We have found right now that 
a hybrid remote / in-person format most effectively builds community around the teaching and learning which in turn 
leads to an increased chance of graduation.
